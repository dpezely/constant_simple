<h2 id="Introduction">
<span class="sectionNumber">1.</span>
	 I<span class="smallcaps">ntroduction</span>
</h2></p>
<p>
You will learn the least you need to know to author a custom shader for
Mental Ray 3.1 and have it function within Softimage XSI 3.0.  This should
work with older versions also.
</p>
<p>
It's helpful being familiar with rendering either as an artist using a 3D
modeling package or as a programmer with a basic working knowledge of ray
tracing.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully you understand programming principles such as what an object or
data structure is.  You should also know what a Property Page within
Softimage XSI is.  It's helpful to have used some of the standard shaders
bundled with XSI and Mental Ray.
</p>
<p>
(But if you're a software developer unfamiliar with XSI, I'll supply the
least you need to know about XSI and its interface to see that this thing
really works.)
</p>
<p>
<h2 id="Overview">
<span class="sectionNumber">2.</span>
	 O<span class="smallcaps">verview</span>
</h2></p>
<p>
Let's create the simplest of shaders for the Mental Ray rendering engine:
the constant material.  There's no distinction between ambient or diffuse
colors.  The entire geometry object appears as a single, solid color blob
without definition beyond its silhouette.
</p>
<p>
An associated Property Page within Softimage XSI enables the artist to
adjust only one parameter: color value.  
</p>
<p>
This is intended to be the simplest yet complete case.
</p>
<p>
From an engineer's perspective, it does almost nothing but does it
correctly.
</p>
<p>
From the artist's perspective, however, once this custom shader has been
installed, there should be no difference between how this option is used
versus any standard feature built into the software as supplied by the
vendor.
</p>

<p>
<h2 id="CSB">
<span class="sectionNumber">3.</span>
	 C<span class="smallcaps">ustom</span> S<span class="smallcaps">hader</span> B<span class="smallcaps">asics</span>
</h2></p>
<p>
Shaders tap into the rendering pipeline via data structures:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li> one structure for receiving parameters supplied by the artist such as
color selection,
<li> one structure for receiving vectors describing a ray of light and its
associated color value and
<li> one structure for resulting color values that may be passed to another
shader in the pipeline.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Shaders do their work by examining yet another data structure for the
associated geometry object.  So if the object selected is a polygon mesh
torus, you have access to its internals as if Mental Ray was just a strange
database and XSI was its data entry front-end.  (This fourth structure is
accessible via library calls and referencing the structure containing input
parameters.)
</p>
<p>
Parameters from the XSI Property Page are passed through a shader-specific
data structure.  By convention, this gets a name matching your shader.
</p>
<p>
Since our shader is called "constant_simple", the data structure is called
"constant_simple_params".
</p>
<p>
Mental Ray has its own data types for just about everything.  Color values
are contained within a type, "miColor".  Other values are held within
"miScalar".
</p>
<p>
When extracting values from the primary data structures, it's important to
use macros defined in "shader.h".  (Find this include file within the XSI
SDK; see <a href="makefile.linux" >makefile</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Apart from C/C++ code and resulting shared libraries, XSI needs to be
informed about the add-on.  There is an interface file that looks like a
Unix shell script.  Mental Ray has its ".mi" file (meaning Mental Images,
the vendor of Mental Ray), and Softimage has its own file format.  SPDL is
Softimage Plug-in Definition Language, and the associated file extension is,
oddly enough, ".spdl".
</p>



<p>
<h2 id="SC">
<span class="sectionNumber">4.</span>
	 S<span class="smallcaps">ource</span> C<span class="smallcaps">ode</span>
</h2></p>
<p>
The coding style builds upon examples provided by Softimage.  (Specifically,
see the "show_edges" example provided with the XSI SDK documentation.)
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="constant_simple.cpp" >C++ source</a> and <a href="constant_simple.h" >header</a>
files for the "constant_simple" example.  Both files are simple enough that
it's easier for a programmer to read the code than to explain it here.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps more important to a tutorial is the 
<a href="constant_simple.spdl" >SPDL file</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Shader Wizard supplied by Softimage creates templates of a C++ file and
the various associated files like the SPDL.  The templates should compile
under both Unix and Windows.
</p>
<p>
Optionally, you can take the files provided with this tutorial and expand
upon them.  Keep this in mind!  There's nothing special about what the
Wizard creates.  It merely spares you from having to perform search and
replace.  Converting from existing files is handy especially if using
Mozilla.  (For Unix folks, the Shader Wizard seems to only like the Java VM
plug-in that ships with RedHat and Netscape's branded browser.)
</p>
<p>
The tutorial files were created without directly using the Wizard, including
the SPDL file.
</p>

<p>
<p id="SPDL"><b>Softimage Plug-in Definition Language (SPDL)</b></p></p>
<p>
Within the SPDL file, there is a GUID parameter with a value of
"1AC592BF-DEA4-11d5-92BD-009027219F81".  There are other parameters with
similar looking values.  
</p>
<p>
These values are not random and must be preserved!
</p>
<p>
Each Parameter that needs to appear within the XSI Property Page (GUI)
should have the same key as above.  Likewise, all outputs have their own.
</p>
<p>
(Why this level of detail has been imposed on the programmer rather than
being optional reflects that Softimage was momentarily owned by Microsoft
while XSI was being developed.)
</p>
<p>
The PropertySet defines the inputs and outputs familiar to anyone who has
used the XSI render nodes.  Most material shaders would have "diffuse" and
"ambient" inputs and a single "out" or output.
</p>
<p>
The first one from the PropertySet belongs to the output parameter.  With
most shaders, the type will be a color value.
</p>
<p>
The second parameter is "color".  I could have used another name such as
"insideColorValue" but instead kept things simple.  This also demonstrates
that there are separate name spaces within the render mechanism.
</p>
<p>
The "title" associated with each input or output parameter provides the
ToolTip pop-up text when using the render view (network diagram of shader
nodes).  And there's another one mentioned below regarding a ToolTip in the
PropertyPage (GUI).
</p>
<p>
The values for our particular input are a white-space delimited list of
numerical Floats.  Legal values for colors are between 0.0 and 1.0,
inclusively.
</p>
<p>
The following means: Use Red at 75%, Green at 12%, Blue at 80% and set the
Alpha channel mask to opaque.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
value = 0.75 0.12 0.80 1.0;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Even if the XSI artist has his or her workstation configured to use
Hue/Saturation/Value (HSV) instead of RGB, the application deals with the
conversion.  Programmers must use RGB.
</p>
<p>
Other member values within the input and output parameters should be
straight-forward to anyone familiar with using XSI.  (Shader programmers
should have a day-long overview of XSI at minimum before changing these
additional values.)
</p>
<p>
Further down the SPDL file, the "Defaults" section seems to repeat some of
the parameters.  The "description" associated with each input or output
parameter provides the ToolTip pop-up text when using the XSI Property Page
(GUI).  Although this will typically be identical to the previous one for
the render node, sometimes it will be appropriate to have different wording
from a usability stand-point.
</p>
<p>
The filename is specified in the final section.  For everyone's sanity, just
keep the names consistent through all files and structures.
</p>


<p>
<h2 id="BFS">

	 B<span class="smallcaps">uilding</span> F<span class="smallcaps">rom</span> S<span class="smallcaps">ource</span>
</h2></p>
<p>
You must have an installed and configured version of Softimage XSI with the
SDK.  While the demo version should be able to use the add-on, you need the
full version for compiling.
</p>
<p>
<h3 id="ULaI">Unix: Linux and Irix</h3></p>
<p>
<pre>
% tar zxf constant_simple.tgz
% cd constant_simple
</pre>
</p>
<p>
There are separate versions of the "makefile" for <a href="makefile.linux" >Linux</a>
versus <a href="makefile.irix" >Irix</a>.  (On Linux, the test build used Mandrake 9.0
so RedHat should work fine; for Slackware, you'll require tweaking.)
</p>
<p>
Compile the source and install it.  A <a href="make.sh" >make script</a> is supplied to
ensure the proper environment variables are defined.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
% ./make.sh -f makefile.linux all install
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Or
</p>
<p>
<pre>
% ./make.sh -f makefile.irix all install
</pre>
</p>
<p>
During installation, XSI will run in batch mode without any associated
windows or panels.  (Depending upon the software license available to you,
it may use the actual Batch mode or possibly Enterprise mode.)  This may
take a few minutes to load-- be patient.
</p>
<p>
Assuming it installed without errors, start XSI normally.
</p>
<p>
The add-on should appear in the "User" path from the
Render-&gt;Texture-&gt;More... pop-up.  
(More about use and testing <a href="#Using The Custom Shader" >below</a>.)
</p>



<p>
<h3 id="Windows">Windows</h3></p>
<p>
For the non-Unix crowd, there is a <a href="constant_simple.dsp" >.dsp file</a> in the
tar file.  It was adapted from a custom shader example written by Softimage.
Good luck.
</p>

<p>
<h3 id="WWC">Windows With Cygwin</h3></p>
<p>
If you have XSI with the SDK on Windows and have installed Cygwin, follow
these commands.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Understand that the final step is untested.  I have been unable to
find a Windows XSI installation that has the SDK, so final compiling and
linking known to work under Unix can only be theorized to work here.  Most
of the legwork, however, has been done for you.  You should only need to
copy and paste the commands below, building with the scripts provided.
</p>
<p>
The only compiler tested was GNU g++/gcc 3.2 via Cygwin.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/" >http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a>
</p>
<p>
If you have the Cygwin utilities (Bash, Perl, gnu compilers, etc), try the
following.
</p>
<p>
First, copy the shader source files to the cygwin directory:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
% cd cygwin
% ln -s ../constant_simple* .
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Convert the Windows command/batch file, Setenv.bat, to a CSH script file.
"C:/Softimage/XSI_*/Application/bin/Setenv.bat" becomes "Setenv.csh".
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, much of the syntax used here converts directly and scripts are
provided.  Use either <a href="cygwin/bat2sh.pl" >bat2sh.pl</a> or
<a href="cygwin/bat2csh.pl" >bat2csh.pl</a>, depending upon whether you use Bash/ash/sh
or tcsh/csh, respectively.
</p>
<p>
From the directory including the makefile, run:
<pre>
% ENVBAT=/cygdrive/c/Softimage/XSI_3.0/Application/bin/
% ./bat2sh.pl $ENVBAT/Setenv.bat &gt; XSI_Setenv.sh
</pre>
</p>
<p>
(Depending upon your workflow, you might also want to convert your workgroup
environment variables,
~/Softimage/XSI_*/Addons/workgroup_shader_plugins.bat, by saving an
equivalent .csh file in that same directory-- not our source directory.)
</p>
<p>
Perform the compilation.  Install and test as you would with the Unix
versions.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
% ./make.sh all install
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The only change is that there is an <a href="cygwin/XSI.sh" >XSI.sh</a> file in our
"cygwin" directory for Bash/sh and <a href="cygwin/XSI.csh" >another</a> for tcsh/csh.
To launch XSI from the command-line, be sure to use one of these scripts.
</p>
<p>
You should, however, be able to just launch XSI from the Windows Start menu
or desktop icon as normal.
</p>


<p>

</h2></p>
<p>
Assuming the custom shader was compiled and installed without errors from
the previous steps, start XSI as you normally would.
</p>
<p>
Create an object such as a polygon mesh torus or cube, then apply the magic
texture.  (Press F1 to bring up the Model menu on the left side, then select:
Get-&gt;Primitive-&gt;Polygon&nbsp;Mesh-&gt;Torus)
</p>
<p>
From the Render menu (F3), select Get-&gt;Texture-&gt;More....  A pop-up window
appears.  Go to the "Paths" pull-down in the upper left corner of the
pop-up.  Change the path to "User".
</p>
<p>
From the list of files, you should see "constant_simple".  Select this, then
click "OK".
</p>
<p>
If you are prompted for whether to create a local material, click Yes.
</p>

<p>
<h2 id="VTSRW">
<span class="sectionNumber">7.</span>
	 V<span class="smallcaps">erifying</span> T<span class="smallcaps">he</span> S<span class="smallcaps">hader</span> R<span class="smallcaps">eally</span> W<span class="smallcaps">orks</span>
</h2></p>
<p>
The default way in which XSI loads a custom texture is to chain it through
the scene default material such as Phong.
</p>
<p>
Because of this, be skeptical as to whether the custom add-on is doing the
work or if built-in functionality is providing the effect.
</p>
<p>
Bring up the Render view.  (Assuming you have the usual four view panels
with your object appearing from a different angle in each-- move the mouse
to one of the bottom panels and press 7.  Or from that viewport's title bar
pull-down menu, change to "Render Tree".)
</p>
<p>
You should see the network diagram with "constant_simple" on the left,
"Scene Material" on the right and a few nodes in between.
</p>
<p>
Remap the connections from our shader to the Scene Material, bypassing
everything in between.
</p>
<p>
Connect the "constant_simple" node output to three of the "scene material"
inputs: "Surface", "Shadow" and "Photon".  (Drag from the red dot in the
upper right corner of "constant_simple" node to inside "scene material".
From the pop-up, select "shadow".  Repeat for the other two parameters.
These parameters and only these should have a dot next to their names in the
pop-up, making it easier to find them.)
</p>
<p>
Some of the the original connections are still there, so next, we delete
them.
</p>
<p>
Leave only the "constant_simple" and "scene material" nodes and of course
the connections we just established.  (Hold the space bar while selecting
with the mouse: draw a box around or through the unwanted nodes.  Make sure
only unwanted items become white, then press Delete.)
</p>
<p>
Let's see it work.
</p>
<p>
Create a render region around the object in one of the viewports if you
haven't done so already.  (Move the mouse to a panel with the wireframe
object.  While holding the "q" key, diagonally drag a box around the object.
Release the q key.)
</p>
<p>
Fiddle with the color value for the custom shader.  (While holding the space
bar, click on the "constant_simple" node in the Render window.  Release the
space bar.  Press Alt+Enter and the Property Page should appear if it wasn't
up already.  Using the color slider should be obvious, but to change from
HSV to RGB or vice-versa, click on the button just to the left of the color
slider.)
</p>
<p>
Notice that the parameter is called "color" and is identical to the
parameter named in the SPDL and C++ files.
</p>
<p>
Move the color slider in the Property Page, and watch the color change in
the render region!
</p>

</h2></p>
<p>
Before re-installing a custom shader, you must first uninstall it.  
</p>
<p>
XSI kindly reminds you of this, should you happen to forget.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
% ./make.sh -f makefile.linux uninstall
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Or
</p>
<p>
<pre>
% ./make.sh -f makefile.irix uninstall
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Or for Cygwin
</p>
<p>
<pre>
% cd cygwin
% ./make.sh uninstall
</pre>
</p>
<p>
It's recommended that you use XSI via batch mode to remove the add-on rather
than just walking the directory tree and deleting files.
</p>


<p>
<h2 id="Summary">
<span class="sectionNumber">9.</span>
	 S<span class="smallcaps">ummary</span>
</h2></p>
<p>
You have a complete set of C++ and the supporting SPDL files to create a
simple shader.  It does almost nothing but does it properly.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the possibilities, this example barely makes a dent.
</p>
<p>
If what you observed here appeals to you at all, jump into shader
development.

This example shader started life as a baby Rubik's cube example supplied by
Mental Images in their manual on the Softimage web site.

</p>
<p>
(TIP: If any softimage.com links require a password, replace "3.0" in the
URL with "2.0.2" or "2.0" and supply "index.html" or "ray-Content.html"
filename instead of directly browsing a directory.)
</p>

</p>

<p>
A little reverse-engineering and simplifying the code created our example.

</p>




<p>
Look at examples.
</p>
<p>
There's one bundled with the XSI SDK.  The shader reveals all triangles on
an object's surface.  It provides minimal parameters from within an XSI
